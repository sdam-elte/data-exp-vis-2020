Shapefiles consist of many files, some of which store the geographic information, some the coordinate system description, some the additional attributes of the geographical objects. [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) is able to read shapefiles natively into its base class GeoDataFrame, which has a similar API to that of `pandas` `DataFrames`. This is convenient, because we can use all of our previous knowledge of `pandas`.*\n",

For this exercise, the spherical coordinate system of lon, lat values is not convenient, since we cannot calculate distances in meters as easily as we would in a Cartesian coordinate system. Because of the Earth's shape, most projections distort distances at certain latitudes and longitudes.*\n",

    "*In GIS, different coordinate systems are called CRS (Coordinate Reference System), and have patented codes that define the origin, the projection etc. The usual lon, lat pairs are called the WGS84 system (you will need to find its epsg code first). A good choice for a Cartesian system is for example the Pseudo-Mercator projection. The `pyproj` library is especially lightweight to use in Python.*"

The advice is to write a function that converts a list of coordinates from a polygon into a GeoJSON feature, then add it to your GeoJSON structure.*"
