Scientific programming and data science is still in an evolutionary phase and will for quite some time. In all research related fields, the creation and exploration of new tools is followed by  standardization and embedding. As long as a tool does not have a more suitable alternative it will follow this path of consolidation. Once an alternative appears the new tool will go through all these phases again. 

Besides the syntax and architecture of these tools (such as a programming language) there are more or less settled guiding principles how these should be used in order to make it more useful on a longer term for both the creator and the community.

What are these principles? What is the motivation to comply with these principles? And what applications, platforms, tools are there?

## Comprehensive readings
* A journal 
There are probably many portals, where people share their ideas and experiences in various topics. One of these is
https://towardsdatascience.com/ which is part of medium.com. Anyone can write and publish here their thoughts. 

* A book about datascience and python
that you might find useful:
[Data Science Scratch Principles Python](
https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130)
[Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EXemKvvNVk) and a [repository](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) for the python codes used within the book.

* A document about reproducible research
https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/reproducible-analysis-workshop/latest/reproducible-analysis-workshop.pdf

## Platforms and tools
* Version control, sharing of code
